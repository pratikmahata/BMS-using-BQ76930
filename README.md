# BMS-using-BQ76930
Battery Management System (BMS) plays an very important role while dealing with multiple batteries. Here I've used BQ76930 by Texas Instruments and tried to make the connections and design as simple as possible.

## Overview
This project implements a smart Li-ion Battery Management System using BQ76930.

## Features
- 3–10 cells monitoring
- Over/under voltage protection
- Current sensing
- Temperature monitoring
- Passive balancing
- I2C communication

## Imp Hardware Used
- BQ76930
- MOSFETs (CHG/DSG)
- Shunt resistor

## How to Run
1. Connect battery pack
2. Note down the values
3. If using a MCU, than write program as needed
4. Monitor serial output

## Applications
- EV packs
- Cell Monitoring
- Robotics
